C++ is a very powerful language and has a lot of features that make it a good choice for many applications:

- It is fast and efficient. 
- It is a compiled language. 
- Object-oriented programming is very popular in C++. 
- It is a very good language for scientific computing and game development.
- It teaches a lot of low-level concepts that are very useful for programming. 
- The STL (Standard Template Library) is a very important part of the language and it is very easy to use, making it ideal for competitive programming and implementing Data Structures and Algorithms which are crucial for internship and placement preparation. Most companies expect you to know C++ and STL.
- Overall it's a great place to start learning programming.
