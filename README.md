## Why C++ ?

C++ is a very powerful language and has a lot of features that make it a good choice for many applications:

- It is fast and efficient. 
- It is a compiled language. 
- Object-oriented programming is very popular in C++. 
- It is a very good language for scientific computing and game development.
- It teaches a lot of low-level concepts that are very useful for programming. 
- The STL (Standard Template Library) is a very important part of the language and it is very easy to use, making it ideal for competitive programming and implementing Data Structures and Algorithms which are crucial for internship and placement preparation. Most companies expect you to know C++ and STL.
- Overall it's a great place to start learning programming.

## Basics of C++

### Input and Output

```cpp
cout << "Hello World!" << endl;

string name;
cout << "Enter your name:\n";
cin >> name;
cout << "Hello " << name << endl;
```

### Variables and Data Types

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| int | Integer |
| float | Floating point number |
| char | Character |
| bool | Boolean |
| string | String |

```cpp
int x = 5;
float f = 0.01;
char c = 'c';
bool b = true;
string s = "Don't stop at cpp. Once you get familiar with low level concepts learn Rustand functional programming languages like Ocaml";
```

### Operators

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| + | Addition |
| - | Subtraction |
| * | Multiplication |
| / | Division |
| % | Modulo |
| ++ | Increment |
| -- | Decrement |
| += | Addition and assignment |
| -= | Subtraction and assignment |
| *= | Multiplication and assignment |
| /= | Division and assignment |
| %= | Modulo and assignment |

### Control Structures

| Structure | Description |
| --- | --- |
| if | Conditional statement |
| else | Alternative to if |
| else if | Alternative to if |
| switch | Switch statement |
| case | Case statement |
| default | Default case |
| for | For loop |
| while | While loop |
| do while | Do while loop |
| break | Break statement |
| continue | Continue statement |

### Functions

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Arrays

```cpp
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
``` 

### Pointers

```cpp
int *ptr;
ptr = &arr[0];
```
